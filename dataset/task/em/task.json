( team edition for software testers can be purchased separately or as part of the visual studio team suite 2005 suite of programs . ) network impersonation load testing simulates users accessing the application using a mix of network connections . view larger . besides the predefined test types ; web load unit manual and ordered visual studio 2005 includes a generic test type that can be used to extend testing capabilities . view larger . browser impersonation allows testers to a heterogeneous browser mix when testing load against a web application . view larger . a new way to test in the past because testing tools were kept separate from development tools feedback was sometimes challenging bugs were hard to trace down when separate systems were used and performance testing was usually done after the development cycle was near complete . all of this added cost time and ultimately stress to the development lifecycle . team edition for software testers addresses these issues by integrating and streamlining the testing process into your entire development cycle . with team edition for software testers you can reduce the complexity of testing applications by offering access to advanced testing tools and features from within the visual studio integrated development environment ( ide ) to create and run tests . by providing all members of a software team access to an overall shared warehouse for integrated feedback and reporting you can tightly integrate testing into their software development collaboration . team edition for software testers lets you accurately simulate production workloads in different environments analyze and troubleshoot bottlenecks prior to deployment and use cost-effective cpu based load agent licensing to simulate virtual users . you can also quickly automate and run tests by creating customizable and dynamic web tests using the web test recorder . this allows you to create commonly used tests using out-of-the-box test types or extend your test framework using generic tests . team edition for software testers features visual studio team test consists of three main areas testing types testing environment and extensibility . team edition for software testers offers tester 's access to advanced testing tools and features from one easy location . a number of core test types including unit web load and manual tests as well as the measurement of code coverage are now integrated into visual studio 2005 making it easier then ever before for testers to be an integral part of the development process . because team edition for software testers is tightly integrated within the visual studio 2005 team system software testers can publish results to a common database generate trend and historical reports compare data and determine the number and type of bugs identified as a result of testing . deep integration into the current developer environment along with the traditional project types make it easier for all participants of the development team to access and share information . and by offering a rich extensible infrastructure for customers and third-parties to build upon team edition for software testers includes an infrastructure that allows for two levels of extensibility . the first is designed for individual testers and the second is designed for those who need to extend visual studio . by providing an open architecture visual studio 2005 team system allows for current and future test types from both internal testing staff and external partners to be added . team edition for software testers also features a suite of new test tools . all tests including unit web load and manual testing are first-class citizens in visual studio and can be shared across the organization . the test results can be published to a database and you can generate trend and historical reports compare different kinds of data see how many and which bugs were found as a result of testing and identify which bugs are not linked to a test that could help reproduce them . other advanced features include an automated and data-driven unit testing capability for the developer ; efficient load test generation with easy deployment of test code and reverse deployment of logs and test results ; parallel functional test execution with code coverage load test monitor and performance counters for analysis ; customizable auto generated web tests ; and custom validation and extraction rules and the web test plug-in that can call code during a test run . msdn premium subscriptions team edition for software testers includes an msdn premium subscription . an msdn premium subscription provides continuous priority access to the technologies you need to support team edition for software testers and build a broad range of applications and web services including the latest versions of windows server 2003 windows 2000 server windows 2000 professional windows 2000 advanced server windows xp professional edition windows xp home edition and future windows releases .

          "description": "the sims was one of the most popular games ever made . in it players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people or sims and influence their paths toward success or something akin to a nervous breakdown . its open-ended blend of cartoonish behavior and everyday living is unique in an art form otherwise obsessed with carnage and sports . with the sims 2 longtime fans now have a deeper game with lots of ways to customize and share their experiences . the game will also attract first-timers because the goal-oriented gameplay and the luridly fun starter families make it easier to get into the action right out of the box . now sims are born with the traits of their parents families grow and sims grow old . the people in your neighborhood the game starts at the neighborhood level . here you can create a housing development from scratch or start with one of three premade neighborhoods each with its own theme . from there you 'll settle on a house and a family of sims to control . create your own sim ( above ) or your own house ( below ) from scratch with advanced tools . aside from the basic needs carried over from the previous game sims now have aspirations wants and fears . the wants and fears are the day-to-day things that occupy their minds like wanting to see friends or get married and fearing death or being rejected for a kiss . satisfy their wants and they become more efficient at completing tasks you assign them . realize their fears and sims become lethargic cranky and unresponsive to your commands . aspirations are the big-picture things like raising a family becoming wealthy and gaining knowledge . succeed here and you 'll be able to buy odd gifts for your sim to improve his or her life like a money tree that pays dividends or a fountain of youth water cooler . what else is new ? of course you would n't be able to juggle all that if it were n't for the improved free will option which makes it easier for sims to fulfill their basic needs . the artificial intelligence of the game is noticeably improved ; they wo n't turn on radios just as a family member is going to bed but strangely they do occasionally put their dishes on the floor . another big change in the series is the concept of the lifespan . now sims are born with the traits of their parents families grow and sims grow old . not only does this go hand in hand with aspirations ( growing up is the first aspiration that a baby sim will have ) it provides a limited time with which your sims can achieve their goals . the universal control panel helps you manage your sim family . a family affair the sims 2 not only lets you create just about any type of sim in any type of family build elaborate houses and even create a neighborhood from scratch but it also allows you to start the game in medias res with premade households . these families all have backstories that are smart spoofs of soap-opera plots -- lots of scheming romance ghosts and family fighting . parents of teens should n't worry though because nudity is tastefully blurred out and woo-hoo between sims takes place completely under the covers . the esrb has given this a teen rating . if the sims 2 were a film it would likely land between pg and pg-13 . the makers have included some nice tools to help share the universe you 've created . for example you can capture in-game stills and video to show friends the private moments family interactions and house parties of your sims . you can even package a household to share as a blog or an album on a special web site . the sims 2 is for patient gamers . like life itself the game is filled with mundane details like getting ready for work and doing dishes . the game also demands a level of creativity from its players that the run-and-gun game genres would n't know what to do with . but those who stick with it will be rewarded with an absorbing amusing diversion and a virtual family history that they 've created themselves . -- porter b. hall set up a sims 2 machinima studio amazon.com contributor porter hall reveals how you can make movies using the sims as your actors . see his guide to setting up a sims 2 machinima studio ."
